# plane-notify-delayed
An extension to plane-notify, that posts flights delayed to meet demands of Mr.Musk at Twitter ;(

- After the [2022 Decemeber Twitter massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2022_Twitter_suspensions) of ElonJet and news reporters.
- Twitter announced that "we will remove any tweets or accounts that share someone's live location"
- Elon Musk - "Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info. Posting locations someone traveled to on a slightly delayed basis isn't a safety problem, so is ok."
- So we arrived here (plane-notify-delayed), as musk says we must delay (atleast on Twitter lol). other platforms ASAP still


## Flow
Connects to the postgres database that plane-notify uses, watches for aircraft that have Twitter accounts/that have delay on, checks for new flights which have reached 24 hours old as of landing.
